# Advent of Code 2023

## Index

| Day | Title          |

## Running the code
To run this code, you will need [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) 1.15
installed. I recommend using [rtx](https://github.com/jdx/rtx) to install
and use Elixir. It is a handy tool for installing different versions of a
large number of languages and tools.

Once you have Elixir installed, navigate to the directory for the code/day you
want to run and run the following commands. This example shows how to run 
Trebuchet, but the method is the same for all the days. 
```
mix escript.build
./trebuchet input
```
